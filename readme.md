## R1 |	Overview

### 	Purpose

We have selected to create an app - named Gold Label - for our client Ania. Ania is a property manager and owner, whom privately manages her extensive portfoio of residnetial properties which spans across Australia and the globe. For this assignment, our web app will be based particularly around her Central Coast properties. Gold Label will facilitate as a digital hiring/booking interface, for interested parties looking to host their next function, whether that may be a wedding, corporate event or birthday.  Essentially a digital portfolio where Ania can advertise her properties, and where people can book and hire those properties. 

### 	Functionality/ Features

- Allow intersted parties to view her properties online, as potential venues for their next event.
- Allow the users to select desired property and book online.
- Landing page that includes an about us, contact - where only the contact details are staticlly displayed for simplicity - and socials. 
- Image upload for our client to add new properties.
- A My Bookings page, where users are displayed within a page what they have booked.
- Drop down menu in "properties" tab so users have ease in being directed to properties that suit their event ie. Weddings, Corporate and Birthdays. 

### 	Target Audience

Two main target audiences that Gold Label will be intended for. The first is for interested parties that are looking for a venue to host an event in the Central Coast, whether are expectant newly weds, companies and work-forces, and anyone else looking for a place to celebrate their birthday. The latter - and smaller - target audience will be for Ania and her internal administration team for the app.

## R4 |	User Stories

We started our users stories by brainstorming personas, and then in no particular order, wrote down said user stories as they came to mind, then we elaborated further on the ideas and then structgered them in a way so that it made logical sense and then proceeded to reorder the user stories into their respective section under  "users" and "business owner".
