## R1 |	Overview

### 		Purpose

We have selected to create an app - named Gold Label - for our client Ania. Ania is a property manager and owner, who privately manages her extensive portfolio of residential properties which spans across Australia and the globe. For this assignment, our web app will be based particularly around her Central Coast properties. Gold Label will facilitate as a digital hiring/booking interface, for interested parties looking to host their next function, whether that may be a wedding, corporate event, or birthday. Essentially a digital portfolio where Ania can advertise her properties, and where people can book and hire those properties. 

### 		Functionality | Features

- Allow interested parties to view her properties online, as potential venues for their next event.

- Allow the users to select desired property and book online.

- A landing page that includes an about us, contact - where only the contact details are statically displayed for simplicity - and socials. 

- Image upload for our client to add new properties.

- A My Bookings page, where users are displayed within a page what they have booked.

- Dropdown menu in "properties" tab so users have ease in being directed to properties that suit their event ie. Weddings, Corporate and Birthdays. 

  

  ### 	Target Audience

Two main target audiences that Gold Label will be intended for. The first is for interested parties that are looking for a venue to host an event in the Central Coast, whether are expectant newlyweds, companies and work-forces, and anyone else looking for a place to celebrate their birthday. The latter - and smaller - target audience will be Ania and her internal administration team for the app.

## R4 |	User Stories

We started our user's stories by brainstorming personas, and then in no particular order, wrote down said user stories as they came to mind, then we elaborated further on the ideas and then structure them in a way so that it made logical sense and then proceeded to reorder the user stories into their respective section under "users" and "business owner".

### 		Users

As a user, I would like to see which properties have been booked, so that I know what's available.

As a user, I would like to view different categories of events, so that I may select the most appropriate property for my event.

As a user, I would like to be able to cancel bookings and receive a cancellation confirmation email.

As a user, I would like to know information about the properties, in order to see if they meet my needs.

As a user, I would like to make an account in order to keep track of my current bookings.

As a user, I would like to leave reviews of past events I had at the properties.

As a user, I want to be able to contact the venue owner, in order to make inquiries about the advertised properties for my future event. 	

### 		Business Owner

As a business owner, I would like to edit and delete my listings, to make sure everything is always up to date as to not confuse potential customers.
